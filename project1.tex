\section{Mini-Project Requirement and Datasets}

This project as a warm-up aims to explore feature extractions using existing networks, such as pre-trained deep neural networks and scattering nets, in image classifications with traditional machine learning methods.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick up ONE (or more if you like) favourite dataset below to work. If you would like to work on a different problem outside the candidates we proposed, please email course instructor about your proposal.  
\item Team work: we encourage you to form small team, up to FOUR persons per group, to work on the same problem. Each team just submit ONE report, \emph{with a clear remark on each person's contribution}. The report can be in the format of either Python (Jupyter) Notebooks with a detailed documentation (preferred format), a \emph{technical report within 8 pages}, e.g. NIPS conference style 
\begin{center}
\url{https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles} 
\end{center}
or of a \emph{poster}, e.g. 
\begin{center}%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/publications/poster_CleaveBioCPH2017_ForReview.pptx}
\url{https://github.com/yuany-pku/2017_math6380/blob/master/project1/DongLoXia_poster.pptx}
\end{center}
\item In the report, show your proposed scientific questions to explore and main results with a careful analysis supporting the results toward answering your problems. Remember: scientific analysis and reasoning are more important than merely the performance tables. Separate source codes may be submitted through email as a zip file, GitHub link, or as an appendix if it is not large.    
\item Submit your report by email or paper version no later than the deadline, to the following address (\href{mailto:deeplearning.math@gmail.com}{deeplearning.math@gmail.com}) with Title: \underline{Math 6380P: Project 1}. % (\href{mailto:datascience\_hw@126.com}{datascience\_hw@126.com}). 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Challenge}
The basic challenge is 
\begin{itemize}
\item Feature extraction by scattering net with known invariants; 
\item Feature extraction by pre-trained deep neural networks, e.g. VGG19, and resnet18, etc.;
\item Visualize these features using classical unsupervised learning methods, e.g. PCA/MDS, Manifold Learning, t-SNE, etc.; 
\item Image classifications using traditional supervised learning methods based on the features extracted, e.g. LDA, logistic regression, SVM, random forests, etc.;
\item *Train the last layer or fine-tune the deep neural networks in your choice; 
\item Compare the results you obtained and give your own analysis on explaining the phenomena.
\end{itemize}

Below are two candidate datasets. Challenge marked by * above is only optional. 

\subsection{MNIST dataset}

Yann LeCun's website contains original MNIST dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. 

\url{http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/}

There are various ways to download and parse MNIST files. For example, Python users may refer to the following website:

\url{https://github.com/datapythonista/mnist}

or MXNET tutorial on mnist

\url{https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/tutorials/python/mnist.html}

\subsection{Fashion-MNIST dataset}

Zalando's Fashion-MNIST dataset of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, of size 28-by-28 in grayscale. 

\url{https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist}

As a reference, here is Jason Wu, Peng Xu, and Nayeon Lee's exploration on the dataset in project 1:

\url{https://deeplearning-math.github.io/slides/Project1_WuXuLee.pdf}

\subsection{Cifar10 dataset} 

The Cifar10 dataset consists of 60,000 color images of size 32x32x3 in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. It can be found at 

\url{https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html}

%\noindent Attention: training CNNs with such a dataset is time-consuming, so GPU is usually adopted. If you would like an easier dataset without GPUs, perhaps use MNIST or Fashion-MNIST (introduced below).


\subsection{Identification of Raphael's paintings from the forgeries}

The following data, provided by Prof. Yang WANG from HKUST,

\url{https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-yDtwSjhaSCZ2FqN3AxQ3NJNTA&usp=sharing}

\noindent contains a 28 digital paintings of Raphael or forgeries. Note that there are both jpeg and tiff files, so be careful with the bit depth in digitization. The following file

\url{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tMaaSIrYwNFZZ2cEJdx1DfFscIfERd5Dp2U7K1ekjTI/edit}

\noindent contains the labels of such paintings, which are 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[1] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[2] Raphael
\item[3] Raphael
\item[4] Raphael
\item[5] Raphael
\item[6] Raphael
\item[7] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[8] Raphael
\item[9] Raphael
\item[10] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[11] Not Raphael
\item[12] Not Raphael
\item[13] Not Raphael
\item[14] Not Raphael
\item[15] Not Raphael
\item[16] Not Raphael
\item[17] Not Raphael
\item[18] Not Raphael
\item[19] Not Raphael
\item[20] My Drawing (Raphael?)
\item[21] Raphael
\item[22] Raphael
\item[23] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[24] Raphael
\item[25] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[26] Maybe Raphael - Disputed
\item[27] Raphael
\item[28] Raphael
\end{enumerate}
There are some pictures whose names are ended with alphabet like A's, which are irrelevant for the project. 

The challenge of Raphael dataset is: can you exploit the known Raphael vs. Not Raphael data to predict the identity of those 6 disputed paintings (maybe Raphael)? Textures in these drawings may disclose the behaviour movements of artist in his work. One preliminary study in this project can be: \emph{take all the known Raphael and Non-Raphael drawings and use leave-one-out test to predict the identity of the left out image; you may break the images into many small patches and use the known identity as its class.}

%\section{Drug Efficacy Data}
%
%Thanks to Prof. Xianting Ding at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Prof. Chih-Ming Ho from University of California at Los Angeles, we have the following datasets on combinatorial drug efficacy.
%
%The first dataset consists of two experiments, all with the same 4 drugs in cell lines for attacking leukemia, with 256 experiments of combinatorial drug dosage at 4 levels. The response is the therapeutic window measuring the efficacy with a trade-off by toxicity.

%\section{Heart PCI Operation Effect Prediction}
%
%The following data, provided by Dr. Jinwen Wang at Anzhen Hospital, 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/data/heartData_20140401.xlsx}
%
%\noindent contains 2581 patients with 73 measurements (inputs) as well as a response variable indicating if after the heart operation there is a null-reflux state. This is a classification problem, with a challenge from the large amount of missing values. Sheet 3 and 4 in the file contains some explanation of the data and variables. 
%
%The problems are listed here:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item The inputs (covariates) are of three kinds, measurements upon check-in, measurements before PCI operation, and measurements in PCI operations. For doctors, it is desired to find a prediction model based on measurements before the operation (including check-in). Sheet 2 in the file contains only such measurements.
%\subitem The following two reports by LV, Yuan and LI, Xiao, respectively, might be interesting to you:
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/reference/MSThesis.LvYuan.pdf} 
%
%\url{http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04656} 
%
%\item It is also an interesting problem how to predict the effect based on all measurements, with lots of missing values. Sheet 1 contains the full measurements. There are some good work by previous students, which are listed here for your reference: 
%%\subitem The following two reports by LU, Yu and WANG, Qing, are probably inspiring to you.
%%
%%\url{http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaoy/reference/LuYu_201303_BigHeart.pdf} 
%%
%%\url{http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaoy/reference/WangQing_201303_BigHeart.pdf}

%\subitem The following report by MIAO, Wang and LI, Yanfang, pioneers in missing value treatment. 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/reference/MiaoLi2013S_project01.pdf}
%
%\end{enumerate} 

%\emph{In the final project, it is desired to take only those measurements upon check-in to predict the probability of non-reflux (non-reflow) after PCI operations. An interpretable model adds a big value! You may compare with your first warm-up project to show your improvements.} 
%
%
%\section{SNPs Data}
% This dataset contains a data matrix $X\in \R^{p\times n}$ of about $n=650,000$ columns of SNPs (Single Nucleid Polymorphisms) and $p=1064$ rows of peoples around the world. Each element is of three choices, $0$ (for `AA'), $1$ (for `AC'), $2$ (for `CC'), and some missing values marked by $9$. 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/ceph_hgdp_minor_code_XNA.txt.zip}
%
%\noindent which is big (151MB in zip and 2GB original txt). Moreover, the following file contains the region where each people comes from, as well as two variables {\texttt{ind1}} and{\texttt{ind2}} such that $X({\texttt{ind1}},{\texttt{ind2}})$ removes all missing values. 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/data/HGDP_region.mat}
%
%\noindent More detailed information about these persons in the dataset can be also found at
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/data/HGDPid_populations_ALL.xls}
%
%Some results by PCA can be found in the following paper, Supplementary Information.

%\section{Protein Folding} 
%Consider the 3D structure reconstruction based on incomplete MDS with uncertainty. Data file: 
%
%\url{http://math.stanford.edu/~yuany/course/data/protein3D.zip}
%
%\begin{figure}[htbp]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../2013_Spring_PKU/Yes_Human.png}  
%\caption{3D graphs of file PF00018\_2HDA.pdf (YES\_HUMAN/97-144, PDB 2HDA)}
%\label{yes_human}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%
%\noindent In the file, you will find 3D coordinates for the following three protein families: 
%\subitem PF00013 (PCBP1\_HUMAN/281-343, PDB 1WVN), \\
%\subitem PF00018 (YES\_HUMAN/97-144, PDB 2HDA), and \\
%\subitem PF00254 (O45418\_CAEEL/24-118, PDB 1R9H). \\
%
%For example, the file {\tt PF00018\_2HDA.pdb} contains the 3D coordinates of alpha-carbons for a particular amino acid sequence in the family, YES\_HUMAN/97-144, read as
%
%{\tt{VALYDYEARTTEDLSFKKGERFQIINNTEGDWWEARSIATGKNGYIPS}}
%
%\noindent where the first line in the file is 
%
%97	V	0.967	18.470	4.342
%
%\noindent Here
%\begin{itemize}
%\item `97': start position 97 in the sequence
%\item `V': first character in the sequence
%\item $[x,y,z]$: 3D coordinates in unit $\AA$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\noindent Figure \ref{yes_human} gives a 3D representation of its structure. 
%
%
%Given the 3D coordinates of the amino acids in the sequence, one can computer pairwise distance between amino acids, $[d_{ij}]^{l\times l}$ where $l$ is the sequence length. A \emph{contact map} is defined to be a graph $G_\theta=(V,E)$ consisting $l$ vertices for amino acids such that and edge $(i,j)\in E$ if $d_{ij} \leq \theta$, where the threshold is typically $\theta=5\AA$ or $8\AA$ here. 
%
%Can you recover the 3D structure of such proteins, up to an Euclidean transformation (rotation and translation), given noisy pairwise distances restricted on the contact map graph $G_\theta$, i.e. given noisy pairwise distances between vertex pairs whose true distances are no more than $\theta$? Design a noise model (e.g. Gaussian or uniformly bounded) for your experiments. 
%
%When $\theta=\infty$ without noise, classical MDS will work; but for a finite $\theta$ with noisy measurements, SDP approach can be useful. You may try the matlab package SNLSDP by Kim-Chuan Toh, Pratik Biswas, and Yinyu Ye, downladable at \url{http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/SNLSDP.html}.
